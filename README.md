Caesar Cipher
========

A PHP web site that takes a text input and shift value from a user, and creates a Caesar Cipher with that information.

What is a Caesar Cipher?
---

A Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher, where each letter in the original text is substituted with another letter in the alphabet a fixed number of positions away.

Example:

Plain text: "Hello World"

Caesar Cipher with a right shift of 3: "Khoor Zruog"

"H", shifted 3 letters to the right, is "K."
"e", shifted 3 letters to the right, is "h."
etc...
